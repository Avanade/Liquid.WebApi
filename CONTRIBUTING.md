## Contribute
Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file issues, and make pull-requests.
- You can provide feedback by filing issues on GitHub. We accept issues, ideas and questions. 
- You can contribute by creating pull requests for the issues that are listed. Look for issues marked as _good first issue_ if you are new to the project.

In any case, be sure to take a look at [the contributing guide](https://github.com/Avanade/Liquid-Application-Framework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting.
